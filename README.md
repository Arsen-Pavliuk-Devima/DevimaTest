###  Hello, this is an test task which allow you to get data from Star-Wars api and store it localy.</br>
Base url: `https://web-devima-api-hsdnemd6bka7gwfq.germanywestcentral-01.azurewebsites.net/`</br></br>
Here is some docs:</br>
1. GET `People` - also accept `page`(default value = 1) and `pcsPerPage`(default value = 10) as query params. Retrun list of data and save to db;</br>
2. GET `People{id}` -- accept `id` as a path option and firstly get data from table, then call api.</br>

If ypu have any questions feel free to ask !</br>
*If you noticed that api work a bit slow, it because my Azure sub do not more allow me to host programms on EU region, so i hosted it in South America :)
